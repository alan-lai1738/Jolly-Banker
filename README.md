# Jolly-Banker
A Back-End Bankiing application that processes transactions.

#Overview
1. This program reads in a string of transactions from a file into an in-memory queue. These transactions can open accounts, withdraw funds, deposit funds, transfer funds, or ask for the transactional history to be printed.
2. This program reads from the queue and processes the transactions in order.
3. When the queue has been depleted the program will print out all open accounts and balances in those accounts.
